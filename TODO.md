# Implementation Plan

This project will provide a unified interface to various TTS services. The initial steps are:

1. **Core Interface**
   - Define a common interface for TTS providers.
   - Implement basic wrappers for each service (placeholders for now).

2. **CLI Tooling**
   - Provide a command-line interface to trigger TTS generation.

3. **Configuration**
   - Support configuration files for authentication tokens and service settings.

4. **Testing**
   - Add unit tests for core functions.
   - Set up continuous integration to run `pnpm test`.

5. **Documentation**
   - Expand the README with usage examples and advanced topics.

This file will be updated as the project progresses.
