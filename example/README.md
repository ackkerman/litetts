# React Example

This folder contains a minimal React application built with Vite. It shows how to call the LiteTTS REST API from a browser.

## Usage

Install dependencies and start the dev server:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

The dev server proxies `/v1` requests to `http://localhost:3000`, so run the LiteTTS server locally before launching the frontend.
